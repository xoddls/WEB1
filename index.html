    <h2>WEB 무엇인가</h2>
    <p>The World Wide Web (abbreviated WWW or the Web) is an information space where documents and other web resources
        are identified by Uniform Resource Locators (URLs), interlinked by hypertext links, and can be accessed via the
        Internet. English scientist Tim Berners-Lee invented the World Wide Web in 1989. He wrote the first web browser
        computer program in 1990 while employed at CERN in Switzerland. The Web browser was released outside of CERN in
        1991, first to other research institutions starting in January 1991 and to the general public on the Internet in
        August 1991.
